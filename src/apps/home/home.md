# Introduction

The Awesome Analytics Apps Template will enable you to serve a site full of awesome analytics apps.

An example of a site built using this Template is [awesome-panel.org](https://awesome-panel.org)

Checkout the menu in the sidebar or the [Gallery](gallery) for example apps.

## Flexibility & Power

The template supports apps developed in a combination of code `.py` files and jupyter notebook `.ipynb` files.

The template supports apps developed using a combination of **Bokeh**, **Panel** and/ or **IPyWidgets**.

The template is running on top of the Tornado server which is rock solid and super fast.

## Maintainability & Scalability

The template has been developed from long term experience developing analytics apps in different frameworks like Angular, Django, Panel and Streamlit.

The template structure and batteries included will enable you to develop, maintain, refactor and scale your site.
